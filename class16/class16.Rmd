For a data frame, if extracting data from it with **dataframe[1,]** or **dataframe[,1]**, it will result in a vector, not a data frame, therefore may result in some error downstream of the coding. In this case, if we want to retain the dimensionality of the data, can use **dataframe[,1, drop = FALSE]**
